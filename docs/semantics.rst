Semantics
====================================

The node representation holds no semantic information, but it is sometimes very convenient to have such semantic information about nodes when writing mutators.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

.. automodule:: semantics
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :inherited-members:
    :show-inheritance:
    :member-order: = alphabetical
